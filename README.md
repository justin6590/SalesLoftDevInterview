# SalesLoft Code Challenges

This app fulfills the following code challenges:

*`Part 1`*: Show a list of People records that are available via the API.  Display each Person’s name, email address, and job title.

*`Part 2`*: Create a button that, when clicked, displays a frequency count of all the unique characters in all the email addresses of all the People you have access to, sorted by frequency count.

*`Part 3`*:  Create a 2nd button that would show us a list of suggested possible duplicate People.  A human can tell that “benoliv@salesloft.com” and “benolive@salesloft.com” are very likely the same person with just one of the email addresses having a typo.  However we would like you to decide what might constitute a duplicate - up to you.
